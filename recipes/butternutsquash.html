<h5>Ingredients</h5>
<ul>
    <li>2 Bunches of Sage</li>
    <li>1 Butternut Squash</li>
    <li>1 lb. of Whole Wheat Penne Pasta</li>
    <li>4 tbsp of Butter</li>
    <li>4 tbsp of Whole Wheat Flour</li>
    <li>1 cup of Half & Half</li>
    <li>1 cup of Skim Milk</li>
    <li>1/4 cup of Grated Parmesan Cheese</li>
    <li>1/8 tsp of Cinnamon</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of Panko Breadcrumbs</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of Blue Cheese</li>
    <li>Sriracha for finishing</li>
</ul>

<h5>Steps:</h5>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 425 F. Heat a medium pot of water to boiling. Pick sage leaves. Peel and medium dice the squash</li>
    <li>In a large pan, melt the butter on medium-high. Once melted, add the sage leaves and cook about 1-2 minutes or until dark green and crispy. Transfer the leaves to a paper towel, season with salt and pepper, leaving butter in the pan</li>
    <li>Sprinkle the whole wheat flour into the butter and whisk until combined. Cook on medium-high heat about a minute until golden. Whisk in the milk and/or Half and Half until no lumps remain. Reduce heat to low and season with salt and pepper. Simmer 2-3 minutes, stirring until the sauce thickens. Remove from heat</li>
    <li>While sauce simmers, add the squash to the boiling water. Cook 7-9 minutes or until very soft when pierced with a fork. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the squash to the bechamel sauce, leaving water in pot. Using a whisk or fork, mash the squash into the sauce until thoroughly combined. Stir in cinnamon, then season with salt to taste</li>
    <li>Add the pasta and a pinch of salt to the water used to cook the squash. Cook the penne until al dente. Before draining, reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water. Transfer drained penne, pasta water, and parmesan and blue cheese crumbles to the squash-bechamel mixture. Stir until well combined.</li>
    <li>Transfer the bechamel-pasta mixture into a baking dish. Drizzle the panko with olive oil and season. Sprinkle the crumbs over the casserole. Bake 5-7 minutes or until golden brown and bubbly. Crumble the crispy sage over the top and drizzle with sriracha</li>
