<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1/2 cup of Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
    <li>2 cloves of Garlic, finely minced</li>
    <li>1 tbsp of fresh Thyme, minced</li>
    <li>1 tbsp of fresh Rosemary, chopped</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp of ground Black Pepper</li>
    <li>1 cup of warm Water</li>
    <li>2 1/4 tsp of active Dry Yeast</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp of Honey</li>
    <li>2 1/2 cups of All-Purpose Flour</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp of fine Sea Salt</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a cold, medium skillet, combine olive oil, minced garlic, thyme, rosemary, and pepper. Place the pan over low heat and cook, stirring occasionally, 5-10 minutes or until aromatic, but before garlic browns. Set aside</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, combine the warm water, yeast, and honey. Stir a few times then let sit for 5 minutes</li>
    <li>Add 1 cup of the flour and a 1/4 cup of the infused garlic-olive oil mixture to the bowl with yeast and honey. Stir 3 to 4 times until the flour has moistened. Let sit for another 5 minutes</li>
    <li>Stir in the remaining 1 1/2 cups of flour and the salt. When the dough comes together, transfer to a floured board and knead 10-15 times until smooth</li>
    <li>Transfer the dough to a large oiled bowl, cover with a warm, damp towel and let rise for 1 hour. It's best to the let the dough rise in a warmer area of your kitchen</li>
    <li>After 1 hour, heat the oven to 450 F</li>
    <li>Use 2 tbsp of the remaining olive oil and garlic mixture to oil a 9-inch by 13-inch rimmed baking sheet</li>
    <li>Transfer the dough to the baking sheet then press it down into the pan. Use your fingers to dimple the dough then drizzle the top with the remaining 2 tbsp of garlic olive oil. Let the dough rise for 20 minutes until it puffs slightly </li>
    <li>Bake until golden brown, 15-20 minutes. Cool baked focaccia on a wire rack</li>
